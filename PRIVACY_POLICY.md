# Privacy Policy - Synaps Notes

Last updated: 2026-02-27

Synaps Notes is designed to be privacy-first. Core app functionality runs locally on your device.

## Data We Collect

We only collect data needed for features you choose to use:

- Optional Google Sign-In:
  - Data: Google account email address.
  - Purpose: authenticate access to your Google Drive for backup/sync features.
- Optional Google Drive sync/backup/import:
  - Data: files/content you explicitly choose to upload or download.
  - Purpose: app functionality (backup, restore, and file import).

## Data Not Collected for Tracking

- No advertising SDKs.
- No cross-app tracking.
- No sale of personal information.

## Local Processing

- Notes and local AI processing are performed on-device by default.
- Local files and app data remain on your device unless you explicitly use Drive sync/backup/import features.

## Data Sharing

- When Drive features are used, selected data is transmitted to Google APIs to complete those user actions.
- We do not otherwise share your personal data with third parties for advertising.

## Data Retention

- Local app data remains on your device until you delete it.
- Data stored in your Google Drive is retained according to your Google account settings until you remove it.

## Security

We use platform-provided iOS security mechanisms and HTTPS network transport for remote API requests.

## Children

Synaps Notes is not directed to children under 13.
