### Model download failed

- Retry download from the Models section.
- If needed, delete partial model download and start again.

### Import from Files/Photos failed
- Re-open picker and grant access permission.

- Indexing runs on-device and may take time on large knowledge bases.
- Keep the app open and connected to power for first-time indexing.
